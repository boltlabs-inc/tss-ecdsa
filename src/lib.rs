//! # tss-ecdsa: A library for full-threshold ECDSA key generation and signing
//!
//! This work is based on the threshold ECDSA signature scheme described by
//! Canetti et al.[^cite], using `secp256k1`[^curve] as the elliptic curve. The
//! implementation is more limited than the cited protocol in several important
//! ways:
//!
//! 1. It is full-threshold: _all_ participants holding a share of the private
//! key must collaborate to produce a signature.
//!
//! 2. It does not implement key refresh. The paper ties this into the aux-info
//! protocol, but we removed the components that are only used to update the
//! participants' private key shares.
//!
//! 3. It does not implement identifiable abort. That is, the protocol will
//! abort if a party misbehaves, but we did not implement the procedures for
//! identifying which party was responsible.
//!
//!
//! ## Background
//! In a threshold signature scheme, a set of participants derive an asymmetric
//! key pair such that each of them holds only a share of the private signing
//! key, corresponding to a single public verification key. To produce a
//! signature, a group of size at least `t` of the signers can collaborate to
//! produce a valid signature for a message, while any subset of `t-1` signers
//! will be unable to do so (or to forge a valid signature).
//!
//! With the cited threshold ECDSA protocol, signatures are validated by a
//! regular (non-threshold) ECDSA verification function.  In fact, signatures
//! generated in this threshold manner are indistinguishable from signatures
//! generated using a normal ECDSA signing method.
//!
//! # üîí Requirements of the calling application
//! This library **does not** implement the complete protocol. There are several
//! security-critical steps that must be handled by the calling application. We
//! leave these undone intentionally, to allow increased flexibility in
//! deploying the library, but this does mean that it requires cryptographic
//! expertise to advise on security of the remaining components.
//! These caller requirements are highlighted throughout the documentation with
//! the üîí symbol.
//!
//! 1. Networking. The protocol requires point-to-point channels between
//! individual participants, as well as a UC-secure, synchronous broadcast
//! mechanism. This library currently supports broadcast using the
//! echo-broadcast protocol described by Goldwasser and Lindell[^echo], so the
//! calling application only has to implement point-to-point channels.
//! This may change in future library versions.
//!
//! 2. Secure persistent storage. The protocol is composed of four subprotocols,
//! each taking input and returning output. The calling application must persist
//! this output and provide it at subsequent protocol executions. Some of the
//! outputs are private values that should be stored securely. See
//! [`Participant`] for more details.
//!
//! 3. Identifier creation. To create a [`Participant`], the calling
//! application must specify a session [`Identifier`] and
//! [`ParticipantIdentifier`]s for each party. We do not specify a protocol for
//! creating these; depending on the trust assumptions of the deployment, the
//! caller can select an appropriate protocol that will ensure that all parties
//! agree on the set of identifiers. See [`Identifier`] and
//! [`ParticipantIdentifier`] for more details. They must satisfy several
//! properties:     
//!     1. All identifiers must be consistent across all
//! participants in a session.
//!     2. The session [`Identifier`] must be global and unique;
//! in particular, it must not be reused across multiple protocol
//! instances.
//!     3. The [`ParticipantIdentifier`]s must be unique within the session.
//! A [`ParticipantIdentifier`] assigned to a specific entity can be reused
//! across multiple session by that entity.
//! They should not be reused for different real-world entities; we don't make
//! any guarantees about system behavior when [`ParticipantIdentifier`]s are
//! reused in this way.
//!
//! # ‚ö†Ô∏è Security warning
//! The implementation in this crate has not been independently audited for
//! security! We have also not released a version that we have finished
//! internally auditing.
//!
//! At this time, we do not recommend use for security-critical applications.
//! Use at your own risk.
//!
//! # Useful features
//!
//! A [`Participant`] processes messages received from other [`Participant`]s
//! and generates [`Message`] for other  [`Participant`]s to process. When the
//! current sub-protocol finishes, output values are produced.
//!
//! Messages may arrive from the network before a [`Participant`] is ready to
//! process them. [`Participant`]s can be given messages at any time; when
//! messages are received early, they are stored in memory by the library and
//! retrieved and processed at the appropriate time.
//!
//! A sub-protocol session automatically progresses between rounds; the calling
//! application does not have to track where within a session the protcool
//! execution is at a given time.
