//! This module implements the auxiliary information protocol.[^cite]
//!
//! This protocol produces auxiliary parameters and public/private key pairs
//! that are needed to run key refresh and presign.
//!
//! # High-level protocol description
//! The auxinfo protocol runs in four rounds:
//! - In the first round, we generate an RSA modulus `N = pq`, alongside
//!   ring-Pedersen parameters `(s, t, Œª)` such that `s = t^Œª mod N`. We then
//!   produce a zero-knowledge proof `ùö∑[prm]` that the ring-Pedersen parameters
//!   are correct. Finally, we commit to the tuple `(N, s, t, ùö∑[prm])` and
//!   broadcast this commitment.
//! - Once we have received all broadcasted commitments, in the second round we
//!   send a decommitment to the commited value in round one to all other
//!   participants.
//! - In the third round, we (1) check the validity of all the commitments plus
//!   the validity of the committed `ùö∑[prm]` proof, and (2) generate the
//!   following proofs about our RSA modulus `N`: `ùö∑[mod]`, which asserts the
//!   validity of `N` as a product of two primes, and a version of `ùö∑[fac]` _for
//!   each other participant_ which asserts that neither factor of `N` is "too
//!   small". (The security of the `ùö∑[fac]` proof depends on the correctness of
//!   the commitment parameters used to create it, so each other party requires
//!   it to be created with the parameters they provided in round two.) We then
//!   send `ùö∑[mod]` alongside the appropriate `ùö∑[fac]` to each other
//!   participant.
//! - Finally, in the last round we check the validity of the proofs from round
//!   three. If everything passes, we output the `(N, s, t)` tuples from all
//!   participants (including ourselves), alongside our own secret primes `(p,
//!   q)`.
