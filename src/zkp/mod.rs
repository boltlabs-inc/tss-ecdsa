//! Implements a trait for zero-knowledge proofs.
//!
//! In more detail, this module provides a trait [`Proof`] for constructing a (non-interactive)
//! zero knowledge proof. The trait provides two methods, [`Proof::prove`] and [`Proof::verify`].
//! The former builds a proof and the latter verifies the proof was constructed correctly.
